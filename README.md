## Repository overview:
- [Data folder](data) with [Toolik]() data, [Greenland]() data, and [Townsend lab]() data
- [Graphs folder](graphs) with figures in progress
- [Code folder](code) contains [old code](code/old) not in use anymore, and the two slightly more organized code files that I'm actively working on. These are split into two sections: [one](code.R) code file for analyzing the experimental snowfence data, and [one](code/observational_data.R) for analyzing the observational leaf nitrogen data
